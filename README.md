- 👋 Hi, I’m @Verox001
- 👀 I’m interested in helping my customers with my programming, as cheap as I can!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more web based programming, like React, Angular and more.
- 💞️ I'm always looking for new cool projects that I like, but of course my clients come first!
- 📫 You can reach me privately at GitHub, Discord (Veroxᵈᵉᵛ#2521) or via Mail (verox@cimeyclust.com).
- Commercial E-Mail: support@cimeyclust.com
